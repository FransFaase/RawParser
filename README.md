# RawParser

This repository contains a single C-file, which, by example,
shows how a grammar driven parser can be implemented. It
explains how a kind of extended BNF grammar can be specified
and how the results of the parsing can be processed by assigning
functions to parts of the grammar.

This is based on an earlier version of IParse
(https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse), which can be found
at http://www.iwriteiam.nl/MM.html
